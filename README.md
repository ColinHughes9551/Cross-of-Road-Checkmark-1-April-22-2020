-CPSC 386 Project Checkmark

-Unzip package and import .uproject file into UE4.

-Level "CHECKMARK_1" is already set up to run the game.

-In the blueprint folder, there are several chicken blueprints, the one entitled "bp_chicken_release" is the most updated, while the others are used for debugging.

-The red cube during gameplay shows the central position of the camera and is not a physical object.

-There is a slight chance the random spawning of trees will block the chicken at the start of the game, you will need to simply play the project again to correct this.
